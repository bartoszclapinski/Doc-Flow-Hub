### Guidelines for DOTNET

#### RAZOR_PAGES

- Organize Razor Pages in feature folders to maintain clean architecture
- Use PageModel properties with data annotations for form validation
- Implement partial views for reusable UI components across multiple pages
- Use route constraints in @page directives to handle different URL patterns
- Apply proper authorization using the [Authorize] attribute or policy-based authorization
- Implement handler methods (OnGet, OnPost) with proper return types (IActionResult)
