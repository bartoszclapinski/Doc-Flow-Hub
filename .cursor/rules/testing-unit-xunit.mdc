## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT_TESTING

#### XUNIT

- Use [Fact] for simple tests and [Theory] with [InlineData] for parameterized tests
- Organize test classes to mirror the structure of the application code
- Use FluentAssertions for more readable assertions when appropriate
- Implement test fixtures with IClassFixture for shared context between tests
- Use Moq for mocking dependencies in unit tests
- Apply AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern for clear test structure
