# Sprint 2 Log: Core Document Management Features

## Sprint Goals
- Implement core document management functionality
- Create document versioning system
- Set up document organization with categories and folders
- Implement proper testing infrastructure

## Progress Log

### Week 1
#### Planned
- [x] Set up document models and storage
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Create document list and details pages
- [ ] Add file upload functionality

#### Completed
1. Document Domain Models Implementation ✅
   - Created core document-related models:
     - `Document.cs` - Main document entity with metadata
     - `DocumentVersion.cs` - Version tracking entity
     - `DocumentCategory.cs` - Category management entity
   - Implemented proper relationships and navigation properties
   - Added necessary data annotations and validations
   - Set up soft delete capability

2. Document Service Interfaces ✅
   - Created DTOs for document operations:
     - `DocumentDto.cs` for data transfer
     - `CreateDocumentRequest.cs` for document creation
   - Implemented service interfaces:
     - `IDocumentService.cs` for core operations
     - `IDocumentStorageService.cs` for file handling
     - `IDocumentCategoryService.cs` for categories

3. Azure Blob Storage Integration ✅
   - Added Azure.Storage.Blobs package
   - Created DocumentStorageOptions for configuration
   - Implemented DocumentStorageService with:
     - File upload with validation
     - File download functionality
     - File deletion handling
     - File hash computation
     - File existence checking
     - File copying support

4. Infrastructure Setup ✅
   - Created dependency injection setup
   - Configured service registration
   - Added proper error handling with ServiceResult
   - Implemented file organization structure:
     ```
     documents/
     └── userId/
         └── yyyy/MM/dd/
             └── unique-guid.extension
     ```

5. Testing Infrastructure Setup ✅
   - Set up test project with proper configuration
   - Updated test packages to latest stable versions:
     - Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk v17.9.0
     - xUnit v2.7.0
     - xUnit.runner.visualstudio v2.5.7
   - Implemented configuration management in tests:
     - Added configuration file linking
     - Proper handling of Azure Storage connection string
     - Environment-specific settings management
   - Created and validated core storage tests:
     - Connection validation
     - File upload with validation
     - Invalid file type handling
     - Upload and download verification

#### Blockers/Issues
- [x] Fixed type mismatch in Document.CurrentVersionId (changed from string? to int?)
- [x] Fixed premature success return in blob storage copy operation
- [x] Fixed blocking constructor in DocumentStorageService
- [x] Fixed Azure Storage authentication issues in tests
- [x] Fixed xUnit version conflicts

#### Bug Fixes Completed ✅
1. Document Model Type Fix
   - Changed `CurrentVersionId` from `string?` to `int?`
   - Added `CurrentVersion` navigation property
   - Ensures proper foreign key relationship with DocumentVersion

2. Blob Storage Copy Operation Fix
   - Implemented proper async copy operation monitoring
   - Added status checking and polling mechanism
   - Implemented cleanup for failed copies
   - Added proper error handling and status verification

3. Storage Service Initialization Fix
   - Removed blocking call from constructor
   - Implemented async lazy initialization pattern
   - Added thread-safe initialization with SemaphoreSlim
   - Proper resource cleanup with IDisposable
   - Added initialization checks to all public methods

4. Testing Infrastructure Fix
   - Removed hardcoded connection strings
   - Implemented proper configuration loading
   - Fixed test project package versioning
   - Added proper file linking for configuration

### Week 2
#### Planned
- [ ] Implement version tracking system
- [ ] Create version history UI
- [ ] Add category management
- [ ] Implement folder structure

#### Completed
- TBD

#### Blockers/Issues
- None yet

## Testing Progress
- [x] Storage service unit tests created
- [ ] Document service unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests implemented
- [ ] Performance testing completed

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using Azure Blob Storage for document storage:
   - Scalable and cost-effective
   - Built-in security features
   - Automatic replication
   - Pay-per-use model

2. Document organization structure:
   - Hierarchical category system
   - Team-based access control
   - Version tracking per document
   - Soft delete implementation

3. Service architecture:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Interface-based design
   - Proper error handling with ServiceResult
   - Async operations throughout

4. Testing architecture:
   - Configuration-based testing
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Proper test isolation
   - Comprehensive storage testing

## Review Notes
- Core models and interfaces established
- Storage service implementation complete
- Testing infrastructure set up and validated
- Ready for CRUD operations implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement document service
2. Create database configurations
3. Set up document endpoints
4. Begin UI implementation
5. Continue with remaining unit tests
