5. Resource Management Fix
   - Implemented proper resource disposal in DownloadDocumentAsync
   - Added XML documentation for Stream disposal requirements
   - Fixed memory management with MemoryStream
   - Ensured proper cleanup of Azure Storage resources

6. Interface and Error Handling Fix
   - Added missing methods to IDocumentStorageService
   - Improved connection string parsing with better error handling
   - Added validation for duplicate connection string keys
   - Enhanced error messages for better debugging

### Week 2
#### Planned

   - Built-in security features
   - Automatic replication
   - Pay-per-use model

2. Document organization structure:
   - Hierarchical category system
   - Team-based access control
   - Version tracking per document
   - Soft delete implementation

3. Service architecture:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Interface-based design
   - Proper error handling with ServiceResult
   - Async operations throughout

4. Testing architecture:
   - Configuration-based testing
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Proper test isolation
   - Comprehensive storage testing

4. Database Configuration Decisions:
   - Soft delete implementation with global query filters
   - Proper cascade delete behaviors for maintaining data integrity
   - Nullable navigation properties for optional relationships
   - String length constraints for better database efficiency
   - Many-to-many relationship tables with proper naming
