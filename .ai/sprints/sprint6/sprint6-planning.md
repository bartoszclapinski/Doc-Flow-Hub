  - FolderId (foreign key, nullable)
- Create Entity Framework configurations
- Design and apply database migration

#### **Phase 6.1.2: Service Layer Foundation**
- Create `IProjectService.cs` interface with methods:
  - GetProjectsForUserAsync, GetProjectByIdAsync

  - GetProjectStatisticsAsync, ShareProjectWithTeamAsync
- Create `IFolderService.cs` interface with methods:
  - GetFoldersInProjectAsync, GetFolderHierarchyAsync
  - CreateFolderAsync, UpdateFolderAsync, DeleteFolderAsync

## üìã TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### **Database Design**
```sql
-- Project Table
Projects: ProjectId, Name, Description, CreatedByUserId, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsActive

-- Folder Table (Self-referencing hierarchy)
Folders: FolderId, ProjectId, ParentFolderId, Name, Path, Level, CreatedByUserId, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt

-- Updated Document Table
Documents: DocumentId, ProjectId (nullable), FolderId (nullable), [existing fields...]

-- Project Team Sharing
ProjectTeamShares: ProjectId, TeamId, SharedAt, SharedByUserId
```

### **Performance Considerations**
- Indexed foreign keys for project/folder relationships
- Computed columns for folder paths
- Efficient hierarchical queries using CTEs
- Pagination for large folder structures
- Caching for frequently accessed folder trees

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Documents without project/folder assignment remain accessible
- Gradual migration path for existing documents
- Default "Unorganized" project for backward compatibility
- Maintain all existing APIs and functionality

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

### **Unit Tests**
- ProjectService tests for CRUD operations
- FolderService tests for hierarchical operations
- DocumentService tests for organization features
- Validation tests for business rules

### **Integration Tests**
- Database relationship tests
- File system integration tests
- Team sharing integration tests
- Search functionality tests

### **UI Tests**
- Navigation component tests
