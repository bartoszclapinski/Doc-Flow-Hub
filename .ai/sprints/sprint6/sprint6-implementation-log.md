- ‚úÖ **Storage Integration**: `DocumentStorageService.DeleteDocumentAsync()` implemented  
- ‚úÖ **Database Support**: Soft delete (`IsDeleted` flag) properly configured
- ‚úÖ **Testing Coverage**: Delete functionality tested in `DocumentServiceTests.cs`
- ‚ùå **Frontend Gap**: NO delete buttons in any UI pages (`Documents/Index.cshtml`, `Documents/Details.cshtml`)
- ‚ùå **Bulk Operations**: NO multi-select or bulk delete interface
- ‚ùå **User Experience**: Complete absence of deletion workflow

### **PRIORITY CHANGE - CRITICAL**
**Original Plan**: Start with Project/Folder database models  
**New Priority**: **Phase 6.0.5 - Document Deletion UI (IMMEDIATE)**  

### **Updated Implementation Order**
1. **Phase 6.0.5**: üö® **Document Deletion Interface** (2-3 days) ‚Üê **NEW IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**
2. **Phase 6.1**: Project/Folder Database Models (Week 1)  
3. **Phase 6.2**: Enhanced UI with Organizational Features (Week 2)  
4. **Phase 6.3**: Advanced Features (Week 2-3)

### **Phase 6.0.5 Implementation Plan**
#### **6.0.5.1: Individual Document Deletion** (Day 1)
- Add delete button to document dropdown in `Documents/Index.cshtml`
- Add delete button to `Documents/Details.cshtml` for owners
- Implement confirmation modal with document metadata
- Add delete handlers to page models with authorization

#### **6.0.5.2: Bulk Document Deletion** (Day 2)  
- Multi-select checkboxes for document listing
