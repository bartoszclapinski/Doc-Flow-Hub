  - `/tests` - for test projects
  - `/docs` - for documentation
  - `/.github/workflows` - for GitHub Actions

### ASP.NET Core Project Setup ✅
- Created ASP.NET Core 8 solution with Razor Pages
- Set up project structure:
  - DocFlowHub.Web (ASP.NET Core Web App)
  - DocFlowHub.Core (Class Library)
