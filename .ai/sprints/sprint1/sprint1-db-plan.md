User profile will store First Name, Last Name, email, and information about teams the user belongs to.
Only metadata and file paths will be stored in the database, not the actual document files.
Category hierarchy will be limited to two levels (main category and subcategories).
Document statuses will include: active, locked for editing, locked, and deleted.
User-team-document relationship: Users can manage their own files, belong to multiple teams, and manage files within their teams.
A document can only belong to one project/folder.
Document versioning will be automatic with every change.
User roles will include administrator (for user and team management) and team-specific roles (team owner, team member).
System will limit to 5 versions per document and approximately 10 categories.
Documents will not have parent-child relationships, only version tracking.
</decisions>
<matched_recommendations>
Implement ASP.NET Core Identity and extend the IdentityUser class with additional fields (First Name, Last Name).
Store document metadata in SQL Server database with file paths pointing to the actual files in the file system.
Use a self-referencing foreign key in the Categories table to handle the two-level hierarchy.
Implement soft delete for documents to maintain data integrity while allowing "deletion" from user perspective.
Design a TeamMember table with a composite primary key (TeamId, UserId) and additional fields for team roles.
Add status fields to documents to manage document states (active, locked, etc.).
Implement timestamp/rowversion mechanism for concurrency control during document editing.
Create a document versioning system that automatically tracks changes with appropriate metadata.
Apply auditing columns (CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ModifiedBy, ModifiedAt) to all major tables.
Use appropriate indexes on frequently searched fields (document title, category, modification date, author).

<database_planning_summary>
Based on the requirements and conversation, the database schema for the MVP should center around four main entity types:
Users and Authentication
Extend ASP.NET Core Identity with custom fields (First Name, Last Name)
Store user authentication and profile information
Link to teams through a many-to-many relationship
Teams and Membership
Teams table with basic team information
TeamMember join table representing the many-to-many relationship between Users and Teams
Store team-specific roles (owner, member) in the TeamMember table
Document Management
Documents table storing metadata only (title, description, file path, status, etc.)
Document versions table with version-specific information
Status field to track document states (active, locked for editing, locked, deleted)
Automatic versioning system limited to 5 versions per document
Each document belongs to exactly one project/folder
Store file paths rather than the actual binary data
Categorization
Two-level category hierarchy (main categories and subcategories)
Self-referencing relationship in the Categories table
Limited to approximately 10 categories
The system will implement proper relationships between these entities with appropriate foreign keys and constraints. Document status tracking will be used to manage editing locks, and automatic versioning will create new version records whenever changes are made to a document.

<unresolved_issues>
Specific document metadata fields that should be stored need to be defined.
Detailed indexing strategy for optimal query performance needs to be determined.
Exact mechanism for document locking during edits needs specification.
Retention policy for old document versions beyond the 5-version limit needs clarification.
Security implementation details at the database level need to be specified.
Database backup and recovery strategy should be addressed.
