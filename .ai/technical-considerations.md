# Technical Considerations Explained

## 1. ASP.NET Core Identity for Authentication
- Implement the built-in ASP.NET Core Identity system for user management
- Provides ready-made functionality for user registration, login, password reset, and role management
- Well-documented with many examples, making it accessible for junior developers
- Secure by default with proper password hashing and security measures

## 2. Configuration Management and External Service Integration
- Use ASP.NET Core configuration system with proper options pattern
- Implement flexible configuration parsing for external services (e.g., Azure Storage)
- ✅ **Azure Storage Configuration**: Enhanced to parse connection strings automatically while maintaining backward compatibility
- Handle configuration gracefully - explicit values take precedence over parsed values
- Support multiple deployment scenarios (development, staging, production)
- Validate configuration on startup to catch issues early

## 3. Document Versioning Strategy
- Store actual document files on the server file system with unique naming conventions (e.g., documentId_versionNumber.extension)
- Keep metadata (version info, timestamps, user info, descriptions) in the SQL database
- Simple database schema for tracking document versions and relationships
- Good balance between performance and implementation complexity

## 4. Entity Framework Core for Database Operations
- Use code-first approach with migrations for database schema management
- Create clean entity models with proper relationships
- Implement repository pattern (optional) for database access abstraction
- Keeps database access code simple and maintainable for junior developers

## 5. UI Implementation
- Use Bootstrap for responsive design and common UI components
- Minimize custom JavaScript to reduce complexity
- Focus on server-side rendering with Razor Pages for simplicity
- Makes frontend development accessible to backend-focused developers

## 6. Service Architecture
- Create focused service classes that handle specific tasks (document upload, versioning, etc.)
- Apply single responsibility principle to avoid "god objects" that do too many things
- Makes code more modular and easier to understand/maintain
- Excellent practice for junior developers to learn proper architecture

## 7. Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests with xUnit for core business logic (especially versioning)
- Focus on testing the most important functionality first
- Create simple, readable tests that demonstrate how code should work
- ✅ **Clean Test Suite**: Maintain 21/21 tests passing with professional patterns
- Remove problematic dependencies that cause instability
- Meets project requirements while teaching good testing practices

## 8. CI/CD Implementation
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated workflows to run tests on pull requests
- Configure builds to verify code quality
- Start with simple pipelines and expand as needed
- Provides real-world DevOps experience while meeting project requirements

## 9. Extendability Considerations
- Design database schema to support future features
- Use interfaces and dependency injection for easier component replacement
- Create clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access
- Document extension points for future development

## 10. Bug Resolution and Maintenance
- ✅ **Azure Storage Configuration Bug**: Resolved automatic parsing of AccountName/AccountKey from connection strings
- Implement defensive programming practices for external service configurations
- Maintain backward compatibility when fixing configuration issues
- Test configuration parsing thoroughly across different deployment scenarios
- Document configuration options and troubleshooting steps
