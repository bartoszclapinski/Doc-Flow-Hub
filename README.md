## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 9 SDK**
- **SQL Server**
- **Azure Storage Account**
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bartoszclapinski/Doc-Flow-Hub.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd Doc-Flow-Hub
```

3. Restore dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

4. Configure the application
   
Create or update `appsettings.Development.json` in the `src/DocFlowHub.Web` directory:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=DocFlowHub;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  },
  "Storage": {
    "ConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=your_account_name;AccountKey=your_account_key;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  }
}
```

To get Azure Storage connection string:
1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Navigate to your Storage Account
3. Go to "Access keys" under "Security + networking"
4. Copy the connection string
5. Replace the `Storage:ConnectionString` value in `appsettings.Development.json`

‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit the actual connection string to source control!

5. Update the database
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/DocFlowHub.Infrastructure --startup-project src/DocFlowHub.Web
```

6. Run the application
```bash
dotnet run --project src/DocFlowHub.Web
```
