```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd Doc-Flow-Hub
```

3. Restore dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

4. Configure the application
   
Create or update `appsettings.Development.json` in the `src/DocFlowHub.Web` directory:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=DocFlowHub;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
